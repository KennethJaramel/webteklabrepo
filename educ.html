		<h2>Education narrowly refers to formal institutional instructions.</h2>
		<h2>Education is a fundamental human right and essential for the exercise of all other human rights.</h2>
		<h2> It promotes individual freedom and empowerment and yields important development benefits.</h2>
		<h2>Education is a powerful tool by which economically and socially marginalized adults and children can lift themselves out of poverty and participate fully as citizens.</h2>
		<h2>According to Article 29 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, the education of the child shall be directed to:</h2>
		<h2>- develop the child’s fullest potential</h2>
        <h2>- develop respect for human rights</h2>
        <h2>- develop respect for the child’s parents and the child’s own cultural identity, and respect for cultures that are different from those of the child</h2>
        <h2>- prepare the child for responsible life in a free society in a spirit of understanding, peace, tolerance, equality of sexes and friendship among all peoples, 
        <h2>ethnic, national and religious groups and persons of indigenous origin and</h2>
        <h2>- develop respect for the natural environment.</h2>

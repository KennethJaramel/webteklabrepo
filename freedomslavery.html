	<h2>Freedom of Slavery</h2><br/>
	<p class="introduction">Nowadays, slavery is one of the problems faced by the society. <br/>
	According to Pope Francis, One of the most troubling of those open <br/>
	wounds is the trade in human beings, a modern form of slavery, which <br/>
	violates the God-given dignity of so many of our brothers and sisters <br/>
	and constitutes a true crime against humanity.</p>
	
	<p class="law">Republic Act No. 9208             May 26, 2003<br/>
	“AN ACT TO INSTITUTE POLICIES TO ELIMINATE TRAFFICKING IN<br/>
	PERSONS ESPECIALLY WOMEN AND CHILDREN, ESTABLISHING THE <br/>
	NECESSARY INSTITUTIONAL MECHANISMS FOR THE PROTECTION AND<br/>
	SUPPORT OF TRAFFICKED PERSONS, PROVIDING PENALTIES FOR ITS<br/>
	VIOLATIONS, AND FOR OTHER”</p>
	
	<p class="advocate">
	A law was created in order to respect and protect the dignity<br/>
	of each Filipino and also to honor human rights. We are obliged<br/>
	in protecting those people who are involved in any kind of violence,<br/>
	discrimination and trafficking.<br/></p>

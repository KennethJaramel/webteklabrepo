					<p id="firstp">The right to privacy states that every
					individual has the right to keep information about themselves
					to be hidden from public.
					</p>
					<p id="secondp">However, this right, like plenty of the others,
					is not absolute. During times of emergency or trouble, where it is 
					vital for the government to know what is going on with the citizens
					of its country, certain information must be gathered such as
					those private to each individual.
					</p>
					<p id="thirdp">Government institutions such as the National
					Statistics Office, NSA, and many others may keep said vital information
					about the individuals, however, it is important for them to keep these
					information private for they could be abused and used for the wrong purpose.
					</p>
					<p id="fourthp">By ensuring this, it will allow individuals to 
					live without worry and be more at ease.

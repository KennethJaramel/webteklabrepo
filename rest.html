			<p id="firstp">it is the right for every living person to be able to 
			have rest and holidays as much as anybody is able to. 
			</p>
			<p id="secondp">This is because it is, first of all, only normal for
			anyone to rest when they are tired. If they are not able to,
			it would rob the people of their right which could lead to
			them being unable to perform their duties and in the worse case,
			might make them grow weaker or catch a sickness.
			</p>
			<p id="thirdp">However, this could also lead people to abuse this 
			right as well. Too much rest would make the person grow truant
			or lax and also be unable to perform their duties in society.
			Therefore, like with any other right, it would be best if it 
			is done in moderation.
			</p>
			<p id="fourthp"> This right is something that is understood 
			without it having be explicitly stated anywhere. It is already a
			fact that governments around the world put up laws that allow every
			worker or laborer to be able to rest or get a holiday.

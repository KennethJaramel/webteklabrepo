				<p>Attitudes, orientations, or behaviors which take the interests, intentions, or needs of other people into account<br> 
			(in contrast to anti-social behaviour) has played some role in defining the idea or the principle. For instance terms<br> 
			like social realism, social justice, social constructivism, social psychology, social anarchism and social capital imply <br> 
			that there is some social process involved or considered, a process that is not there in regular, "non-social" realism, <br> 
			justice, constructivism, psychology, anarchism, or capital.<br> 
			
			The adjective "social" is also used often in politics, although its meaning in a context depends heavily on who is using it. <br> 
			In left-wing politics left-wing circles it is often used to imply a liberal characteristic, while in right-wing circles it is <br> 
			generally used to imply a conservative characteristic. This adjective is used much more often by those on the political left <br> 
			than by those on the political right. For these reasons, those seeking to avoid association with the left-right political <br> 
			debates often seek to label their work with phrases that do not include the word "social". An example is quasi-empiricism in <br> 
			mathematics which is sometimes labelled social constructivism by those who see it as an unwarranted intrusion of social <br> 
			considerations in mathematical practice.<p>
			<h2>Social Justice</h2>
			<p>Social justice is the fair and just relation between the individual and society. <br> 
			This is measured by the explicit and tacit terms for the distribution of wealth, opportunities <br> 
			for personal activity and social privileges. In Western as well as in older Asian cultures, the concept <br> 
			of social justice has often referred to the process of ensuring that individuals fulfill their societal <br> 
			roles and receive what was their due from society. In the current global grassroots movements <br> 
			for social justice, the emphasis has been on the breaking of barriers for social mobility, the creation <br> 
			of safety nets and economic justice.</p>

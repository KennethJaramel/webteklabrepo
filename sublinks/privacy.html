			<p class="paragraph">The right to privacy states that every
			individual has the right to keep information about themselves
			to be hidden from public.</p>
			<p class="paragraph">However, this right, like plenty of the others,
			is not absolute. During times of emergency or trouble, where it is 
			vital for the government to know what is going on with the citizens
			of its country, certain information must be gathered such as
			those private to each individual.
			</p>
			<p class="paragraph">Government institutions such as the National
			Statistics Office, NSA, and many others may keep said vital information
			about the individuals, however, it is important for them to keep these
			information private for they could be abused and used for the wrong purpose.
			</p>
			<p class="paragraph">By ensuring this, it will allow individuals to 
			live without worry and be more at ease.
			</p>
			<p class="paragraph">For all human beings we have rights to have a privacy between our friends and family. 
				And we have all the rights to have a protection of the law if we are in bad situation.</p>

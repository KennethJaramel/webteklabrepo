				<p class="paragraph">Attitudes, orientations, or behaviors which take the interests, intentions, or needs of other people into account 
				(in contrast to anti-social behaviour) has played some role in defining the idea or the principle. For instance terms 
				like social realism, social justice, social constructivism, social psychology, social anarchism and social capital imply 
				that there is some social process involved or considered, a process that is not there in regular, "non-social" realism, 
				justice, constructivism, psychology, anarchism, or capital.</p>
				
				<p class="paragraph">The adjective "social" is also used often in politics, although its meaning in a context depends heavily on who is using it. 
				In left-wing politics left-wing circles it is often used to imply a liberal characteristic, while in right-wing circles it is 
				generally used to imply a conservative characteristic. This adjective is used much more often by those on the political left  
				than by those on the political right. For these reasons, those seeking to avoid association with the left-right political  
				debates often seek to label their work with phrases that do not include the word "social". An example is quasi-empiricism in 
				mathematics which is sometimes labelled social constructivism by those who see it as an unwarranted intrusion of social 
				considerations in mathematical practice.</p>

				<p class="paragraph">Social justice is the fair and just relation between the individual and society. 
				This is measured by the explicit and tacit terms for the distribution of wealth, opportunities 
				for personal activity and social privileges. In Western as well as in older Asian cultures, the concept  
				of social justice has often referred to the process of ensuring that individuals fulfill their societal  
				roles and receive what was their due from society. In the current global grassroots movements 
				for social justice, the emphasis has been on the breaking of barriers for social mobility, the creation  
				of safety nets and economic justice.</p>
